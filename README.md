# My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to the **My-LeetCode-Journey** repository! This project is dedicated to tracking my progress as I solve LeetCode problems regularly. The aim is to grow as a programmer by improving problem-solving skills, learning new techniques, and staying consistent.

## About

This repository contains solutions to a wide variety of LeetCode problems. The solutions are added in no specific order — just as I solve them.

**Key highlights:**

- Problems range from **Easy** to **Hard**.
- Most solutions are written in **Python, C++**.
- Some include brief explanations or comments for clarity.

The goal is not perfection but **progress**.
